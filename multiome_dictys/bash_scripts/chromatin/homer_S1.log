!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	Potential Problem with Sequences (ignore if preparsing genome):
	1 of 596599 removed because they were shorter than 5 bp
		312617 of 596599 removed because they had >70.00% Ns (i.e. masked repeats)
	Due to 	high repeat content, consider using a non-repeat masked genome

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	Potential Problem with Sequences (ignore if preparsing genome):
	1 of 2030946 removed because they were shorter than 5 bp
		1087994 of 2030946 removed because they had >70.00% Ns (i.e. masked repeats)
	Due to 	high repeat content, consider using a non-repeat masked genome
